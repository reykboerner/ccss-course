# Exercise 1: Prime number generator

## Tasks

1. Write a Python program that generates the first 1000 prime numbers.
2. (Optional) Ask generative AI to write a program for you that returns the first 1000 prime numbers. How can you test whether the result is correct? Write a test program that verifies the AI output. (Alternatively, you don't need to ask AI. Just run your test on the result you got in Task 1.)

## Hints
- Use `while`, `if` and `else` statements. You will probably also need the modulo operator (`%` in Python).
- You can manually include the first prime number `2`; all following prime numbers are odd.

> Recap: A prime number is any natural number greater than one whose only divisors are one and the number itself.
